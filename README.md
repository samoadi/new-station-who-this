# new station, who this?

### Description:
	The purpose of this repo is to contain all of the packages and casks 
	that are necessary for me to work. Yes spotify is necessary :D

You can clone and edit the lists for yourself or fork the project so it suites your needs.

- [packages](lists/packages.txt)<br>
- [casks](lists/cask.txt)

## What does it do?

	The script first checks if homebrew is setup, if not it installes the software.
	Once homebrew is ready it goes over the lists and installes them.

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:tripinpurple/new-station-who-this.git
```

<i>Then we can make the shell script executable</i>

```
./install.sh
```
